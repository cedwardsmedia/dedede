# To-do:

1. Add ability to check various parameters of existing Kirby installation.
2. Add ability to change various configuration parameters of existing Kirby installation.
3. Add ability to "git-ify" non-git-based Kirby installation. (i.e. one downloaded explicitly as ZIP file from Kirby site)
4. Consider adding ability to download and install Kirby themes. (long-term)
5. Print debug info on fatal error.
6. Think of something else to add here.
