# To-do:

1. Add ability to check various parameters of existing Kirby installation.
    - Could implement a c::get command and simply use Kirby's API for this.

2. Add ability to change various configuration parameters of existing Kirby installation.

3. Add ability to "git-ify" non-git-based Kirby installation. (i.e. one downloaded explicitly as ZIP file from Kirby site)
    - Could move assets, content, site, etc. to a tmp directory while installing via install(), then return the contents to the new installation.

4. Consider adding ability to download and install Kirby themes. (long-term)
    - Not likely to happen. This would require Dedede to behave as package manager as well.

5. Think of something else to add here.
